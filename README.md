Execute the code by navigating in the bin folder and executing 
```
java mineSweeper.main.MineSweeper
```

## Game Mechanics 
* You can uncover a field with the left mouse button, it then shows the amount of neighboring bombs. If it was a bomb you loose and the game ends. If it does not have a neighboring bomb, all the neighbors are uncovered as well (rekursively). 
* If you think there is a bomb in one field you can use the right mouse button to mark it. When it is marked it cannot be uncovered, but you can remove the mark by clicking the right mouse button again. 
If you uncovered all the fields without bombs, you won the game.

## Model-View-Controller-Pattern and Observer-Pattern
I implemented the Game using the Model-View-Controller Pattern. The game and all the game mechanics are in the model containing the classes game and field. The controller contains all the controls and sends them to the model. The view creates the visuals using Swing and is also an observer of the model so it can change the view depending on the changes in the game.
The observer-pattern is implemented using **java.beans.PropertyChangeSupport**.

## Execution
1. Navigate in the bin folder. 
2. Executing one of the following: 
```
java mineSweeper.main.MineSweeper
```
Creates a default game with 10x10 fields and 10 bombs
```
java mineSweeper.main.MineSweeper 5 15
```
Creates a game with 5x15 fields and 5*15 / 10 = 7.5 ~ 7 bombs
```
java mineSweeper.main.MineSweeper 5 15 10
```
Creates a game with 5x15 fields and 10 bombs
